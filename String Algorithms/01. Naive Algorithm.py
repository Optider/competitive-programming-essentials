# Problem : Prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]

    # Input:  txt[] = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
    #         pat[] = "TEST"
    # Output: Pattern found at index 10

    # Input:  txt[] =  "AABAACAADAABAABA"
    #         pat[] =  "AABA"
    # Output: Pattern found at index 0
    #         Pattern found at index 9
    #         Pattern found at index 12
